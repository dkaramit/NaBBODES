ODE solvers that anyone should be able to take, hack, and use for specific problems they might be interested in solving. The plan is to be able to use the skeleton of RK methods, and be able to pass as arguments everything from just the Butcher tableau to specific step control, and optimizing every step for a chosen RK method. 



---
NaBBODES started from [*ASAP*](https://dkaramit.github.io/ASAP/), but it evolved to an independet thing. Here we will be able to further improve it without keeping things as simple as possible.  That said, things should still be kept simple to allow the user to understand the code.

## To-do:
- [] Stepsize control works, but still need a better one.
- [] Unify the solvers.


That's it for now.

Enjoy,

Dimitris
